# Requirements Document

## Introduction

The application is experiencing critical server deployment issues that prevent successful deployment and operation in production environments. Users are encountering 500 internal server errors, database connection failures, and static function consumption errors that make the application unusable in deployed environments. This feature will systematically address these deployment-related issues to ensure reliable server operation.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want the server to deploy successfully without internal server errors, so that the application can operate reliably in production.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the server starts THEN the system SHALL initialize without 500 internal server errors
2. WHEN API endpoints are accessed THEN the system SHALL respond with valid HTTP status codes
3. WHEN the application boots THEN the system SHALL complete initialization without crashing
4. WHEN health checks are performed THEN the system SHALL report healthy status

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want database connections to work properly in production, so that data operations can be performed successfully.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the application starts THEN the system SHALL establish database connections successfully
2. WHEN database queries are executed THEN the system SHALL not throw "Cannot read properties of null" errors
3. WHEN database operations are performed THEN the system SHALL handle connection pooling properly
4. WHEN database errors occur THEN the system SHALL provide meaningful error messages and recovery mechanisms

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a developer, I want static functions to work correctly in the deployment environment, so that the application can render and function properly.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN static functions are called THEN the system SHALL not attempt to consume dynamic context
2. WHEN server-side rendering occurs THEN the system SHALL handle static/dynamic boundaries correctly
3. WHEN Next.js builds the application THEN the system SHALL properly identify static vs dynamic components
4. WHEN the application runs THEN the system SHALL not throw "Static function can not consume context" errors

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want comprehensive deployment scripts and documentation, so that I can deploy and maintain the application reliably.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN deployment is initiated THEN the system SHALL provide clear, step-by-step deployment scripts
2. WHEN errors occur during deployment THEN the system SHALL provide diagnostic tools and troubleshooting guides
3. WHEN the application is deployed THEN the system SHALL include health monitoring and logging capabilities
4. WHEN maintenance is required THEN the system SHALL provide backup and recovery procedures

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want proper environment configuration management, so that the application can adapt to different deployment environments.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the application starts THEN the system SHALL load environment-specific configurations correctly
2. WHEN database connections are made THEN the system SHALL use environment-appropriate connection strings
3. WHEN API endpoints are accessed THEN the system SHALL respect environment-specific security settings
4. WHEN errors occur THEN the system SHALL log appropriately based on environment (development vs production)

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want to use a modern Node.js version (v22.18.0 or higher), so that the application can benefit from the latest performance improvements and security fixes.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the server environment is prepared THEN the system SHALL support Node.js v22.18.0 or higher
2. WHEN the application runs on the new Node.js version THEN the system SHALL maintain compatibility with all existing features
3. WHEN dependencies are installed THEN the system SHALL resolve any compatibility issues with the new Node.js version
4. WHEN the application is deployed THEN the system SHALL leverage performance improvements from the newer Node.js version
