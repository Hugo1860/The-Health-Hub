# Requirements Document

## Introduction

The admin panel is experiencing data fetching failures and rendering issues that prevent proper functionality. Users are encountering hydration mismatches, deprecated component warnings, and failed API calls that make the admin interface unreliable. This feature will systematically address these issues to ensure a stable, functional admin panel.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As an administrator, I want the admin panel to load without hydration errors, so that I can access all admin functionality reliably.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the admin panel loads THEN the system SHALL render without hydration mismatch errors
2. WHEN server-side rendering occurs THEN the system SHALL generate HTML that matches client-side rendering
3. WHEN React components mount THEN the system SHALL not display "Hydration failed" warnings
4. WHEN the admin panel initializes THEN the system SHALL handle SSR/CSR differences gracefully

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As an administrator, I want all API calls to succeed, so that I can view and manage system data effectively.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the admin dashboard loads THEN the system SHALL successfully fetch dashboard statistics
2. WHEN API endpoints are called THEN the system SHALL return valid responses without 404 or 500 errors
3. WHEN data fetching fails THEN the system SHALL display meaningful error messages to the user
4. WHEN network requests timeout THEN the system SHALL implement proper retry mechanisms

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As an administrator, I want the interface to use current Ant Design components, so that the system remains maintainable and warning-free.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN Ant Design components are used THEN the system SHALL use current, non-deprecated APIs
2. WHEN modals or dropdowns are displayed THEN the system SHALL use `styles.body` instead of `bodyStyle`
3. WHEN positioning components THEN the system SHALL use current placement values
4. WHEN the console loads THEN the system SHALL not display deprecation warnings

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As an administrator, I want proper error handling throughout the admin panel, so that I can understand and resolve issues when they occur.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN API calls fail THEN the system SHALL log detailed error information
2. WHEN components fail to render THEN the system SHALL display fallback UI
3. WHEN errors occur THEN the system SHALL provide actionable error messages
4. WHEN debugging is needed THEN the system SHALL provide clear error traces

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As an administrator, I want the admin panel to handle loading states properly, so that I have clear feedback about system operations.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN data is being fetched THEN the system SHALL display appropriate loading indicators
2. WHEN operations are in progress THEN the system SHALL disable relevant UI elements
3. WHEN data loads successfully THEN the system SHALL smoothly transition from loading to content
4. WHEN operations complete THEN the system SHALL provide clear success feedback
