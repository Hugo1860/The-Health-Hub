# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature aims to replace all demo/mock data in the admin interface with real API integrations. Currently, several admin pages are using hardcoded demo data for display purposes, which needs to be replaced with actual database queries and API calls to provide real-time, accurate information for administrators.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As an admin user, I want the dashboard to display real statistics from the database, so that I can see accurate system metrics and make informed decisions.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I access the admin dashboard THEN the system SHALL fetch real audio count from the database
2. WHEN I access the admin dashboard THEN the system SHALL fetch real user count from the database  
3. WHEN I access the admin dashboard THEN the system SHALL fetch real play count statistics from the database
4. WHEN I access the admin dashboard THEN the system SHALL fetch real comment count from the database
5. WHEN the dashboard loads THEN the system SHALL display recent audios from actual database records
6. WHEN the dashboard loads THEN the system SHALL display recent users from actual database records
7. WHEN the dashboard loads THEN the system SHALL display popular audios based on real play statistics

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As an admin user, I want the users management page to show real user data, so that I can manage actual system users effectively.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I access the users management page THEN the system SHALL fetch all users from the database
2. WHEN I edit a user THEN the system SHALL update the user record in the database
3. WHEN I delete a user THEN the system SHALL remove the user from the database
4. WHEN I search for users THEN the system SHALL query the database with search criteria
5. WHEN I filter users by role or status THEN the system SHALL apply filters to database queries
6. WHEN user statistics are displayed THEN the system SHALL calculate counts from real database data

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As an admin user, I want all admin pages to use consistent API endpoints, so that data management is reliable and maintainable.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN any admin page loads data THEN the system SHALL use standardized API endpoints
2. WHEN API calls fail THEN the system SHALL display appropriate error messages
3. WHEN data is being loaded THEN the system SHALL show loading states
4. WHEN API responses are received THEN the system SHALL handle different response formats consistently
5. WHEN authentication fails THEN the system SHALL redirect to appropriate login pages

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As an admin user, I want real-time activity tracking on the dashboard, so that I can monitor system usage and user behavior.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I view the dashboard THEN the system SHALL display recent system activities from database logs
2. WHEN new content is uploaded THEN the system SHALL record and display the activity
3. WHEN users register THEN the system SHALL record and display the activity
4. WHEN comments are posted THEN the system SHALL record and display the activity
5. WHEN activities are displayed THEN the system SHALL show accurate timestamps and user information

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As an admin user, I want category and content management to reflect real database state, so that I can manage the actual system content.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I access category management THEN the system SHALL fetch categories from the database
2. WHEN I create or edit categories THEN the system SHALL persist changes to the database
3. WHEN I view content statistics THEN the system SHALL calculate metrics from real data
4. WHEN I manage related resources THEN the system SHALL update actual database records
5. WHEN I manage audio chapters THEN the system SHALL store and retrieve real chapter data

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As an admin user, I want proper error handling and data validation, so that the admin interface is robust and reliable.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN API calls fail THEN the system SHALL display user-friendly error messages
2. WHEN network errors occur THEN the system SHALL provide retry mechanisms
3. WHEN data validation fails THEN the system SHALL show specific validation errors
4. WHEN database operations fail THEN the system SHALL log errors and notify administrators
5. WHEN authentication expires THEN the system SHALL handle session renewal gracefully

### Requirement 7

**User Story:** As an admin user, I want performance optimization for large datasets, so that the admin interface remains responsive with real data.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN loading large user lists THEN the system SHALL implement pagination
2. WHEN searching through large datasets THEN the system SHALL use efficient database queries
3. WHEN displaying statistics THEN the system SHALL cache frequently accessed data
4. WHEN loading dashboard data THEN the system SHALL optimize multiple API calls
5. WHEN filtering data THEN the system SHALL perform server-side filtering for better performance
