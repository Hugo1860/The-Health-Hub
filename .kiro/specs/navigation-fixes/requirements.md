# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature addresses two critical navigation and display issues in the medical audio platform:

1. The `/browse` page is not displaying properly, preventing users from browsing audio content by category
2. The settings button in the user dropdown menu should intelligently route admin users to the admin dashboard instead of the regular settings page

These fixes will improve user experience by ensuring proper page functionality and providing role-appropriate navigation.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1: Fix Browse Page Display Issues

**User Story:** As a user, I want to browse audio content by category so that I can discover relevant medical content efficiently.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user navigates to `/browse` THEN the page SHALL display without errors
2. WHEN the browse page loads THEN it SHALL show a list of available audio content organized by categories
3. WHEN API calls fail THEN the system SHALL display appropriate error messages with retry options
4. WHEN no content is available THEN the system SHALL show a user-friendly empty state message
5. IF the categories API fails THEN the system SHALL fall back to default medical categories
6. WHEN users filter by category or search THEN the results SHALL update correctly without page errors

### Requirement 2: Implement Role-Based Settings Navigation

**User Story:** As an admin user, I want the settings button to take me to the admin dashboard so that I can access administrative functions efficiently.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN an admin user clicks the settings option in the user dropdown THEN the system SHALL navigate to `/admin`
2. WHEN a regular user clicks the settings option in the user dropdown THEN the system SHALL navigate to `/settings`
3. WHEN the system determines user role THEN it SHALL use the user's role from the authentication context
4. IF the user role cannot be determined THEN the system SHALL default to the regular settings page
5. WHEN the navigation occurs THEN it SHALL close any open dropdown menus
6. WHEN an admin accesses the admin dashboard THEN they SHALL see the admin interface with proper permissions

### Requirement 3: Improve Error Handling and User Feedback

**User Story:** As a user, I want clear feedback when pages fail to load so that I understand what went wrong and how to proceed.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN API calls fail on the browse page THEN the system SHALL display specific error messages
2. WHEN network errors occur THEN the system SHALL provide retry functionality
3. WHEN authentication fails for admin access THEN the system SHALL redirect to appropriate login page
4. WHEN loading states occur THEN the system SHALL show skeleton loaders or loading indicators
5. IF critical data fails to load THEN the system SHALL provide fallback content or graceful degradation
