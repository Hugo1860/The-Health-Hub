# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature addresses API consistency issues across the application where function names have been updated to use Promise-based patterns, but the implementation still uses legacy parameter patterns (params.id vs modern async/await patterns). The goal is to ensure all API endpoints follow consistent patterns for parameter handling, error management, and response formatting.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a developer, I want all API endpoints to use consistent parameter handling patterns, so that the codebase is maintainable and follows modern JavaScript/TypeScript conventions.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN an API endpoint is called THEN the system SHALL use consistent parameter extraction methods across all routes
2. WHEN a route uses Promise-based function names THEN the system SHALL implement proper async/await patterns throughout the function body
3. WHEN parameters are accessed THEN the system SHALL use the same pattern (either params.id or modern destructuring) consistently across all endpoints
4. IF an endpoint uses legacy params.id pattern THEN the system SHALL be updated to use modern parameter handling
5. WHEN API responses are returned THEN the system SHALL follow consistent response formatting patterns

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a developer, I want proper error handling consistency across all API endpoints, so that debugging and maintenance are simplified.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN an API error occurs THEN the system SHALL return consistent error response formats
2. WHEN database operations fail THEN the system SHALL handle errors using the same pattern across all endpoints
3. WHEN validation fails THEN the system SHALL return standardized error messages
4. IF an unexpected error occurs THEN the system SHALL log the error consistently and return appropriate HTTP status codes

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want all API endpoints to follow the same authentication and authorization patterns, so that security is consistent across the application.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN protected endpoints are accessed THEN the system SHALL use consistent authentication middleware
2. WHEN admin endpoints are called THEN the system SHALL apply uniform authorization checks
3. WHEN authentication fails THEN the system SHALL return consistent error responses
4. IF authorization is required THEN the system SHALL validate permissions using the same pattern across all endpoints

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a developer, I want comprehensive testing for API consistency, so that regressions can be detected early and the system remains reliable.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN API endpoints are tested THEN the system SHALL validate consistent parameter handling
2. WHEN error scenarios are tested THEN the system SHALL verify consistent error response formats
3. WHEN authentication is tested THEN the system SHALL validate consistent security patterns
4. IF API changes are made THEN the system SHALL run automated tests to ensure consistency is maintained
